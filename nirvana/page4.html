        <h1>The Band</h1><hr>
        <img src="images/band.jpg" alt="Nirvana" class="band">
        <h2>How it all started</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Cobain</b> and <b>Novoselic's</b> first band lasted barely a few weeks before it disbanded, leaving the pair to move on.
            However, the duo eventually discovered that Melvins could pull $80 a night for one show. Inspired, Cobain and
            Novoselic started a Creedence Clearwater Revival cover band, in which Cobain played drums and Novoselic sang and
            played guitar. That band was short-lived as well. Some months later, Cobain and Novoselic met drummer Aaron
            Burckhard. While the new band never used the name, it was the first incarnation of Nirvana.
        </p>
        <p>
            Burckhard lasted only a few months and Melvins' drummer Dale Crover filled in until Novoselic and Cobain met Chad
            Channing. The trio recorded their debut album Bleach, released in 1989. Channing left the band in 1990 and was
            briefly replaced by Crover and Mudhoney drummer Dan Peters. Novoselic contributed to the writing of various
            songs, providing ideas for Cobain.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later in 1990, Melvins' singer-guitarist Buzz Osborne encouraged Novoselic and Cobain to check out a punk band
            called Scream. The pair were impressed by their drummer, Dave Grohl. A few weeks later, Scream disbanded,
            and Grohl placed a call to Osborne for advice. Osborne gave him Novoselic's phone number, and Novoselic invited
            Grohl up to Seattle (from San Francisco, where Scream broke up). Grohl passed the audition and joined Nirvana. Grohl
            was Nirvana's fifth and final drummer. This was after the first few recordings of songs from their Bleach Album.
            Novoselic spent the following months with Nirvana traveling to various labels as the band shopped for a deal,
            eventually signing with DGC Records.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the spring of 1991, the band entered Sound City Studios in Los Angeles to record Nevermind. Novoselic helped
            write the song "Polly". Upon its release, Nevermind (1991) exceeded all expectations and became a worldwide
            commercial success. Nevermind had launched the band as a worldwide phenomenon with their hit single <b>"Smells
            Like Teen Spirit"</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1992, at the MTV music awards show, Nirvana would win awards for Best New Artist in a Video and Best Alternative
            Video for "Smells Like Teen Spirit." At the show, Nirvana performed "Lithium". When Novoselic started playing the
            opening bass riff, he signaled that he could not hear his bass. Instead of continuing to play, Novoselic threw his
            bass guitar in the air, to perform a "Bass Toss". He failed to catch it, later stating that he misjudged the height;
            he further stated that he "faked like he was knocked out." Musician Brian May ran to give him medical attention; he
            did not suffer any injuries.

            In 1992, Novoselic and the rest of Nirvana recorded a compilation album named Incesticide. Novoselic helped write
            lyrics for the songs "Dive", "Hairspray Queen", and "Aneurysm" on the album. This album was produced by a joint
            venture between DGC and Sub Pop.
        <p>
            During Nirvana's 1992 Reading concert, Novoselic sang "The Money Will Roll Right In" with Cobain. Novoselic was
            an occasional vocalist and backing vocalist in Nirvana, occasionally singing "Scoff" and "Rape Me" at live shows.
            Novoselic stated that <b><i>"I kind of discovered my voice for the first time, and the more I did it, the better it
            got."</i></b>
        </p>
        <p>
            In September of 1993, Nirvana's third album In Utero, debuted at number one on the billboard 200. However, the
            recording sessions mixed by Steve Albini were criticized by the band members, saying some songs "didn't sound
            perfect", as well as the band agreeing that Novoselic's bass lines sounded "too low". In Utero sold 3.5 million
            copies in the United States. In November of that year, Nirvana performed on MTV Unplugged with Lori Goldston
            playing cello, the introduction of guitarist Pat Smear, and Novoselic playing acoustic bass guitar, accordion, and
            acoustic rhythm guitar. This live performance was released a year later as an album, named MTV Unplugged in New
            York, which earned a Grammy Award for best alternative music performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prior to their 1994 European tour, the band scheduled session time at Robert Lang Studios in Seattle to work on
            demos. For most of the three-day session, Cobain was absent, so Novoselic and Grohl worked on demos of their own
            songs. The duo completed several songs, including "Exhausted", "Big Me", "February Stars", and "Butterflies". On
            the third day of the session, Cobain finally arrived. The song "You Know You're Right" was the band's final studio
            recording.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nirvana ended abruptly in April 1994 following Cobain's death. For most of the rest of that year, Novoselic
            retreated from the spotlight. One of a few public appearances came that September at the MTV Video Music Awards,
            where the video for Nirvana's "Heart-Shaped Box" was awarded for Best Alternative Video. Novoselic took the
            opportunity to pay tribute to Cobain.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following the end of Nirvana, Novoselic worked on completing the With the Lights Out box set and From the Muddy
            Banks of the Wishkah album, as well as pushing for release of a 20th anniversary album for Nevermind.(...)
